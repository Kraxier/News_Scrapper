Reflection 
1. Opening a Scrapy Shell 
# how i can Fetch something ignoring the Robot

ABSCBN is the Problem # Let's think about this later

I think the Problem the i currently Facing is there are to many sites
i should focus on things 
    * Focus on the Latest News [Breaking News, Latest Updates]
    * Scrape only 20 - 50 Articles per Website?
    * What Specific News or Niche?
        What i'm Currently Interested? [Sports,Politics,Technology]
            [Nation News, and Politics]
    * Trending Article or Most Read Articles

2. Second Problem is Checking if wether it is a javascript or html
What is the Other way of Checking a Website and not Downloading it ?
    fetch('https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/topstories/') # javscript Website

_________________________________________________

The reason why response.css('.mb-font-author-name.overflow-nowrap a span::text').get() works is because it accurately targets the specific HTML structure of the webpage you're scraping. Let me break it down for you:

1. Understanding the Selector
The selector .mb-font-author-name.overflow-nowrap a span::text can be broken down as follows:

.mb-font-author-name.overflow-nowrap: Targets an element with both classes mb-font-author-name and overflow-nowrap.

a: Targets an <a> tag that is a descendant of the above element.

span::text: Targets the text inside a <span> tag that is a child of the <a> tag.

This selector works because the author name ("John Legaspi") is likely nested inside a <span> within an <a> tag, which itself is inside an element with the classes mb-font-author-name and overflow-nowrap.

2. Why Other Selectors Didn't Work
Hereâ€™s why the other selectors you tried might have failed:

a. Selector: .mb-font-author-name.overflow-nowrap a::text
This selector targets the text directly inside the <a> tag.

If the author name is inside a <span> within the <a> tag (e.g., <a><span>John Legaspi</span></a>), this selector won't work because it doesn't account for the nested <span>.

b. Selector: .mb-font-author-name.overflow-nowrap span a::text
This selector assumes that the <a> tag is inside a <span>, which is not the case in your HTML structure.

In your case, the <span> is inside the <a> tag, not the other way around.

c. Selector: custom-text-link.uppercase.author-name-link.pb-0.mt-1
This selector is incorrect because it doesn't start with a . (for class) or # (for ID). It also doesn't target the text node.

3. Why This Selector Works
The selector .mb-font-author-name.overflow-nowrap a span::text works because:

It correctly navigates the HTML structure:

html
Copy
<div class="mb-font-author-name overflow-nowrap">
    <a href="/author/johnlegaspi">
        <span>John Legaspi</span>
    </a>
</div>
Run HTML
It targets the <span> inside the <a> tag, which contains the author name.

4. Key Takeaway
When writing CSS selectors for web scraping:

Inspect the HTML structure carefully: Use your browser's developer tools (right-click â†’ Inspect) to see the exact nesting of elements.

Target the correct text node: If the text is inside a nested element (e.g., a <span>), include that element in your selector.

Test and debug: Use .extract() to see all matching elements and refine your selector accordingly.

5. Example Workflow
Hereâ€™s how you can debug and confirm the correct selector:

python
Copy
# Print the HTML to inspect the structure
print(response.text)

# Try the working selector
author_name = response.css('.mb-font-author-name.overflow-nowrap a span::text').get()
print("Author Name:", author_name)

# Extract all matching elements for debugging
all_matching_elements = response.css('.mb-font-author-name.overflow-nowrap a span::text').extract()
print("All Matching Elements:", all_matching_elements)
